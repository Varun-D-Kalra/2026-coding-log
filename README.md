# 2026 Coding Log

This repository tracks my daily coding execution in 2026.

## Focus Areas
- **DSA (LeetCode):** topic-wise problem solving to build strong fundamentals
- **Data Analysis:** Pandas / NumPy practice using real datasets
- **Consistency:** daily work with weekly reflection

## Structure
- `DSA/` → one folder per topic, one file per problem
- `pandas/` → one dataset per folder, single evolving notebook
- `weekly-log.md` → weekly review of speed, mistakes, and patterns

## Rule
This repo is an **execution log**, not a tutorial or portfolio.  
Code may be rough. Progress and consistency matter more than polish.
